The movement of the NGIMU during the collection of the OscillatoryMotionTrackingSession dataset is described by the following sequence:
1. Stationary for ~5 seconds
2. Raised ~30cm
3. Stationary for ~5 seconds
4. Raised and lowered ~30 cm repeatedly for an oscillating height for ~5 seconds
5. Stationary for ~5 seconds
2. Lowered ~30cm to return to original height at start of sequence
